I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. This is a rough draft of my personal website - please bear with me as I continue to add content.

My research interests lie broadly in applied econometrics, with a focus on causal inference and machine learning.
