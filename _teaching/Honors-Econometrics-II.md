I TA'd an econometrics course for advanced undergraduate students under Professor Alex Torgovitsky.

This course covers a variety of widely used econometrics methods, including instrumental variables designs, staggered difference-in-differences designs, and regression discontinuity designs. In the problem sets, students implement these methods from scratch using statistical programming languages such as R, Python, or STATA.
